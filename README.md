# Classification_iris_data

#The best way to learn Machine learning is to start with the small dataset.
#Classification of Iris Flowers.

#This Project is the first step to learn Machine Learning

#How to Launch and work with new environments.
# 1. How to load the data 
# 2. How to Handle the data with Pandas Library
# 3. It's a classification problem and we can identify it falls under Supervised Learning
# 4. The dataset is of 4 attributes and 150 rows and one attribute is the class.
# 5. This is the sample dataset which comes with same scale and same attributes.

#After installing python with Scikit libraries. Follow the below steps.

# 1. Check with the libraries and its versions.
# 2. Load Data
# 3. Import Libraries
# 4. Summarize the data
# 5. Data Visualization

#Deciding the Best Supervised Algorithm to estimate the accuracy on unseen data.

# 6. Data Validations
# 7. Building Models
  # a. Logistic Regression (LR)
  # b. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  # c. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
  # d. Classification and Regression Trees (CART).
  # e. Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB).
  # f. Support Vector Machines (SVM).
  
#Execution of these steps makes you understand about the process how to test the dataset accuracy.
